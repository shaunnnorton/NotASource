# Not A Source

This is a work in progress applicaiton that will be a tool to extract the sources from a wikipedia page to aid in the research process. The idea for this project stems from the common phrase uttered by teachers "Wikipedia is not a Source". Using this tool you can use the Wikipedia article as a jumping off point for research to find primary sources to quote in your research!
